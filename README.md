## Genetic-Algorithm-for-CNF-
My version of a genetic algorithm that attempts to solve 3-CNF, along with some comparsion charts and a report about how I tried to improve it, what worked and what didn't.
Run the main file 2019A7PS0135_KUSHAL.py (change the name if you wish), change the parameters (number of variables, number of clauses) to generate random 3-CNF sentences. Run the code and genetic algorithm will try to find the best solution it can within 45 seconds You also need CNF_Creator.py , this is the code that creates the random sentences
